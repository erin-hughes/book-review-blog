New York City is one of my favourite places in the world.

That wasn't always the case. The first time I visited the city I was 16, and I was left more intimidated by The Big Apple than anything. Standing in the streets that I'd been seeing on TV for years was a surreal feeling, almost like standing in the middle of a theme park I'd always wanted to go to. But rather than there being roller coasters or ferris wheels around every corner, I had the creeping feeling that the only thing that waited for me down the smoking alleyways was danger.

I've since gotten over this fear, and have been back to New York half a dozen times in the years since then. Maybe I just needed to experience a bit more life to appreciate the city - at the time, New York was the biggest place I'd ever been. But I think what's more likely is that, as I got older, I understood that edge of darkness that lurks on the edge of the city lights more and more. That I love the city in part because of its edge, and not in spite of it.

I was lucky enough to ring in 2024 in New York City, and it was there that I made my resolution to start reading at least one new book a month. In the name of an auspicious start to my challenge, I went to [The Strand](https://www.strandbooks.com/) to purchase the first book that I would read. And it was there that I saw _The Dead Take the A Train_ staring out at me from shelf.

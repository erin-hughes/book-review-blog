## Intro

I've talked quite a lot on this blog about how, even though I've always been drawn to supernatural and fantasy fiction, I have only been a fan of outright horror for a handful of years. [My piece on Stephen King's _The Shining_](/reviews/the-shining), for example, turned out to be part-review, part-dissection of what my newfound appreciation of the genre says about what the Covid-19 pandemic did to my psyche. But oddly enough, I've always loved Mary Harron's iconic 2000 adaptation of _American Psycho_.

Being a fan of this movie isn't exactly controversial. Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, the titular psycho, is one of the most iconic slasher villains in the entire genre. The movie contains so many memorable scenes, including the [infamous murder of Paul Allen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcavZ-nUgYM&ab_channel=ReckerHawx) as portrayed by Jared Leto, and the [hilarious business card scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1nSwpxRuJo&ab_channel=ANUSREKNAK). For me, though, one of the main reasons that the movie embedded itself in my head the way that it did was because of a comment that the original novel's author, Bret Easton Ellis, made while reflecting on the novel and its relevance to the 21st century.

[Writing in Town & Country](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a4954/american-psycho-today/), Ellis discusses the intentions he had when creating Patrick Bateman and telling his story. He explains that the character was a manifestation of his own feelings of isolation and emptiness at that time, and it was largely by accident that he had given life to an avatar for an entire generation. On what Bateman would be doing if had lived today instead of in the late 80s, Ellis muses that he might have ended up a tech bro in Silicon Valley rather than an investment banker on Wall Street. He writes:

<articlequote author="Bret Easton Ellis" byline="American Psycho Author Bret Easton Ellis Tells Us Where Patrick Bateman Would Be Today">Sometimes I think that if I had written the book in the past decade, perhaps Bateman would have been working in Silicon Valley, living in Cupertino with excursions into San Francisco or down to Big Sur to the Post Ranch Inn and palling around with Zuckerberg and dining at the French Laundry, or lunching with Reed Hastings at Manresa in Los Gatos, wearing a Yeezy hoodie and teasing girls on Tinder.</articlequote>

I've been a professional software engineer for about seven years at the time I'm writing this, and this scenario really resonated with me, because I've worked with Patrick Batemans before. Multiple times in my career I've been confronted with a man impeccably dressed in designer labels, accessorized with a perfect smile that didn't quite meet his eyes. A person who somehow simultaneously radiated disdain for everyone in the room he didn't consider an equal, including me, and yet had this desperate, almost pathetic need to impress. Fortunately I primarily encountered these men when I was much younger, and since then I have worked with many talented developers who were much more authentic people. But I've always been struck by what an astute observation Ellis made with his comments; by how accurately he pinpointed where pretentious hollowness of the 80s has migrated to 40 years later. That, combined with my existing love of the 2000 movie, is what led me to give the Ellis' novel a shot.

## Summary

## Book vs Movie

I had a little trouble figuring out the vector I want to approach this from. All of the reviews I've written so far have been about books that I read for the first time. In this case, because of my existing relationship with the movie, it feels a little unnatural to start discussing whether I like this story - clearly, I do. Additionally, the movie adaptation of the novel is pretty faithful in terms of the core story. The main differences between the two texts, other than some name changes, are the themes that they focus on, and the tone with which they communicate those themes. The movie leans much further into the comedy side of the Wall Street satire than the book does, whereas Ellis' tone is often very apathetic and hollow.

Rather than debating which version is "better", what I find more interesting is digging deeper into the differences that do exist.


## Book vs Movie
- Given my existing relationship with the movie, I don't think there's much point in litigating whether I like the story, because I clearly do.
- The movie is a pretty faithful adaptation of the book, albeit streamlined and with some names changed.
- What's more interesting to me in this case is the differences that do exist, and which medium I found to be the most successful

## Violence
- The book is WAY more graphically violent than the movie.
- The movie tends to tastefully cut away or altogether skip these scenes, which initially I found to be a relief.
- Plus, there's definitely something to the idea that nothing is scarier than what we don't see and cook up in our own imaginations.
- But the more I thought about it, the more I realised that the violence of the book is extremely important to the message that Ellis is trying to get across.
- The whole critique is about violent the consumerist, materialistic attitudes of Bateman's era were. And it's not like those attitudes no longer exist, but, as Ellis so astutely observed, the perpetrators have moved from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. Or, in some cases, to the White House.
- So as uncomfy as it is to read, removing it does remove the sharpness of the argument. It's supposed to be grotesque, because that attitude is grotesque.
- The only violent flashes we see in the movie (the two most famous being the murder of Paul Owen/Allen and Bateman chasing Christie with a chainsaw) almost loop back around to being funny. So you lose a lot of that sense of horror.

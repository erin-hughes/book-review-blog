## Intro

I started this blog to help keep me motivated in my mission to revive my reading habit from my youth. And as a young adult, one of my all time favourite book series was _The Twilight Saga_.

In 2008 Edward and Bella's love story was one of the most important things that had ever happened to me. I had _Twilight_ posters in my room that I used to say goodnight to. _Breaking Dawn_ was THE book I would bring on long holidays, no matter how many times I had already read it. I've been a fan of genre fiction my whole life, but I could probably trace my love of vampire fiction in particular back to this particular phase of my life. I didn't, however, come away from _The Twilight Saga_ with a love of pure romance fiction.

Perhaps Stephanie Meyer ruined me for all others. But when I think about the romances that have had the most impact on me over the years, they have all had some kind of fantasy or science fiction twist to them. There's _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, in which Buffy's two most popular love interests, Angel and Spike, are literal vampires. There are many romantic relationships in _Game of Thrones_ and _House of the Dragon_ to get invested in, but these all take place in a high fantasy setting. Even [Goblin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AcNEVUzV4o), my favourite Korean romance drama, is an urban fantasy story. I have consumed and enjoyed pure romance stories in the past, but given the choice, I prefer that little something extra that comes with a fantasy romance.

By May 2024 my reading mission was going much better than I thought it would; by the beginning of that month I had already read 13 books, exceeding my personal goal of one book a month well in advance. I had managed to squeeze in quite a bit of variety in that time as well, ranging from the horror classic _The Shining_ to the sugary sweet shoujo manga _A Sign of Affection_. But looking back now, towards the end of 2024, I'm surprised that I didn't immediately gravitate towards the fantasy romance that I had loved reading so much when I was a teenager.

A Court of Thorns and Roses was the book series that changed that. Most of the others in my book club are big Sarah J. Maas fans, and often raved about her books in our meetings. So when I stumbled across the first book on sale when buying groceries in early May, I couldn't resist seeing what all the fuss was about. 

## Summary

Feyre Archeron is a 19-year-old huntress, trying to survive in a world that has been split into faerie lands and human lands. On the brink of starvation, she kills what she thinks is a large wolf in the forest near her home. But the wolf was really an immortal faerie in disguise, and before long a terrifying beast appears before Feyre demanding justice for its comrade's death.

Feyre is taken to the faerie land of Prythian by her captor, whom she discovers isn't a beast at all, but a beautiful fae lord called Tamlin. As she is forced to adjust to her new life as the only human in Tamlin's court, she finds that life in Prythian is different from the scary stories that she heard at home. She even finds herself warming up to Tamlin himself.

However, this budding passion is threatened by a darkness that shrouds the whole of Prythian. And even though she has only just been thrust into the world of the faeries, Feyre must fight to save the entire realm.

## Analysis


- this marks my first really foray into booktok literature
- well, my second if you count my disastrous encounter with Colleen Hoover, an author that was inflicted upon me by my book club (which i still haven't fully forgiven them for)

## Conclusion

The highest compliment that I think I can pay _A Court of Thorns and Roses_ is that it's a fantastic jumping off point for the rest of the series. I'm finding reviewing this book on its own awkward in the same way that I found reviewing the first volume of _A Sign of Affection_ awkward; I like the series a lot, but a lot of what I like about it doesn't manifest until the next installment.

If my misgivings about the book - the unexpectedly dark third act, the victim blaming, and so on - are discouraging you from giving it a chance, I understand that, because I struggled with them too. However, while I don't want to
